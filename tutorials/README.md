## Tutorials (English-only)

These docs aim to answer, in order:
1) What am I running and what should I expect to happen?
2) Which parameters control which part of the computation?
3) What are good minimal configs to start from?
4) Where is the exact key-by-key reference?

Start here:
- `tutorials/01-quick-start.md` (end-to-end, OBC)
- `tutorials/02-concepts.md` (high-level view + parameter taxonomy)
- `tutorials/03-recipes.md` (copy/paste configs)
- `tutorials/04-parameter-reference.md` (key reference)

Older drafts and legacy snapshots are kept in `tutorials/deprecated/`.
