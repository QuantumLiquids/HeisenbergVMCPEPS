## Plot Directory Guide

This folder contains two classes of plotting scripts.

### 1) Curated workflow scripts (supported)

Use these for tutorial-driven workflows:

- `plot/workflow/plot_energy_trajectory.py`
- entry documentation: `plot/workflow/README.md`

### 2) Legacy / experimental scripts (historical)

Subfolders such as `plot/square/`, `plot/triangle/`, and `plot/kagome/` contain older MATLAB/Python scripts that were built around specific datasets and evolving file layouts.

These scripts are kept for project history and custom analysis, but are not the canonical tutorial path.

If you are following tutorials, always start from:

- `plot/workflow/`
